***

*Route Visualizer* is a program to plot coordinates from <tt>kml</tt> or <tt>gpx</tt> files (implemented in v0.2.0-beta) onto a map. This results in a highly resolved image file.  

* The current version can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/DAccord/Route-Visualizer/releases/latest). To run, at least Microsoft .NET Framework 4 is required. Unless installed, it can be downloaded [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851) (Web installer) or [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17718) (standalone installer).
* Unfortunately, the [Wiki](https://github.com/DAccord/Route-Visualizer/wiki) is mainly only available in German.
* There you can find the [Changelog](https://github.com/DAccord/Route-Visualizer/wiki/Changelog) as well.
* If you want to report a bug or have an idea how to improve *Route Visualier* feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/DAccord/Route-Visualizer/issues).

*Route Visualizer* was tested on Windows 10. However, the application should run from Windows Vista onwards (if the .NET Framework 4 is installed).
